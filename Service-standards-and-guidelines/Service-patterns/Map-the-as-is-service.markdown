# {{ page.title }}

Identify one of the 7 service patterns across our services. 

Map ‘as is’ for the service area. This includes end to end, front stage and back stage. Journey mapping can be both for online and offline services. When journey mapping, consider as if you were a service user and with services users through user research. 

## Front stage 

When mapping the front stage, consider: 

- user pain points and touchpoints
- user needs across the journey
- where users have come from and where the journey ends with us 

## Back stage 

When mapping the back stage, consider: 

- the activities the service currently undertake across the journey with subject matter experts
- pain points and inefficiencies for the service, for example, front line staff
- existing research and data – this might include contact centre calls and key performance indicator
- tech components
