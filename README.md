### Preview environments

If you want to preview changes before they go live:

- Fork the repository to your own account
- In the forked repository, go to **Settings**-**Pages** and enable Pages from the `master` branch

Google won't index your preview copy of the site, and you should see a 'preview' banner at the top letting you know that you're looking at the preview. Anyone can look at your preview site if they have your URL. 

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JackRyan8/TestingPages/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
