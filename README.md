### Preview environments

If you want to preview changes before they go live:

- Fork the repository to your own account
- In the forked repository, go to **Settings**-**Pages** and enable Pages from the `master` branch
- Still in **Settings**, go to the **Environments** tab
- Click **github-pages**
- Scroll down to the **Environment secrets** section
- Click **Add Secret**
- Under **Name**, enter `JEKYLL_ENV`
- Under **Value**, enter `development`

This will ensure that Google doesn't index your preview copy of the site.

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JackRyan8/TestingPages/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
