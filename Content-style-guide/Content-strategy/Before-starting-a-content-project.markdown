# {{ page.title }}

Before planning your content project, you need to consider if:

- there's a valid [user need]()? who content is for and why they need it
- it's Essex County Council’s (ECC's) job to publish the content?
- the information, advice or guidance is available elsewhere? are you duplicating content?
- essex.gov.uk is the best platform to use? could it be a social media post or a blog?

Go ahead with the project if:

- there’s a clear user need
- it’s ECC's statutory obligation to publish it
- it's an ECC service
- You must have evidence to back the user needs. This could be from Google Analytics data or user feedback.

Don’t go ahead with the project if:

- there isn’t a valid user need
- it’s already published elsewhere, like NHS or GOV.UK
- it’s not ECC’s job to publish it
