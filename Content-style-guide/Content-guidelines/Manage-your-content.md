# Manage your content

After you publish content, you need to check if your content is still meeting user needs and expectations.

You can use data, user feedback and user research to keep improving your service. It’s a cycle of continuous improvement and iteration.

## Understand how people use your content

You need to understand how people are using your content.

[Google Analytics reports](google-analytics-basics) can tell you:

*   which pages people are going to
*   where they are coming from
*   what they do while on the page
*   where they go to afterwards

You can use this date to inform any changes to your content and improve the user journey.

## Keep content accurate

You need to make sure your content is accurate, consistent and up to date.

You should set review dates to check and maintain content. This should be an ongoing  
process to make sure your content is always up to date.

## Do ongoing research

User research shouldn’t stop after you publish your content.

You should do [ongoing research](contents "User need and user behaviour") to understand:

*   your users needs
*   how they interact with your content
*   if the user journey is logical

User needs change over time so it’s important to do ongoing research to make sure you’re iterating content to meet these needs.
