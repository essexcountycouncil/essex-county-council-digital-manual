# What to do with FAQs

Frequently asked questions (FAQs) don’t make good web content. The [Government Digital Service (GDS) discourages them](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk).  
  
If the information is unique, you can help people read it by structuring it and taking it out of the questions and answers format.

## Headings

Headings are important because they jump out at the user and when written well can help users navigate quickly.  
  
Use statement for your headings, rather than questions. You can front load the headings with the keywords.  
  
For example, instead of ‘How do I apply for a school place?’, say ‘Apply for a school place’.

## Structure

Create a logical structure, grouping information about the same topic together, using headings and sub-headings.  
  
Start with the most important point or action. You don’t need to write a lot of background information.

## Avoid repetition

Several questions may have the same answer. You should group these together using a single heading.

## Keep things short

Write in short sentences and short paragraphs, broken up with bullet points wherever you are listing several items.
