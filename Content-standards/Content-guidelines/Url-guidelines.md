# URL guidelines

## URL

URLs should:

* be simple, clear and easy to read
* use lower case letters only
* use dashes to separate words
* be SEO friendly - this means they should contain keywords so they rank highly in search engines

See [URL standards for GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/url-standards-for-gov-uk) for more guidance on best practice URLs.

Examples of good URLs are:

* [www.essex.gov.uk/blue-badge](www.essex.gov.uk/blue-badge)
* [www.essex.gov.uk/register-a-birth](www.essex.gov.uk/register-a-birth)
* [www.essex.gov.uk/emergency-school-closures](www.essex.gov.uk/emergency-school-closures)

URLs should not contain:

* capital letters
* dates
* acronyms where possible
* underscores to separate words

Examples of bad URLs are:

[www.essex.gov.uk/ICS](www.essex.gov.uk/ICS) - acronyms are unlikely to be SEO friendly or understood by users. 

[www.essex.gov.uk/Annual-Report-2014](www.essex.gov.uk/Annual-Report-2014) - dates and time-limit the use of URLs. A better approach would be to use [www.essex.gov.uk/annual-report](www.essex.gov.uk/annual-report) so the URL can continue to be used for subsequent years.

[www.essex.gov.uk/TLC_PROVIDERS](www.essex.gov.uk/TLC_PROVIDERS) - capital letters and underscores make URLs hard to read.

## Short URLs

### What are they?

Short URLs, also known as vanity URLs, are unique, short links that redirect users to a web page that has a longer URL. For example:

[www.essex.gov.uk/cycling](www.essex.gov.uk/cycling) is a short URL that redirects users to [http://www.essexhighways.org/Transport-and-Roads/Getting-Around/Cycling.aspx](http://www.essexhighways.org/Transport-and-Roads/Getting-Around/Cycling.aspx)  

### When to use a short URL

Short URLs should be used for marketing purposes such as campaigns that require a unique campaign identity or have a need for users to remember a web link. They are often used on:

* printed material like posters or leaflets
* videos
* audio (such as radio, podcasts or an automated contact centre message)

They should be clear and easy for people to remember.

### When not to use a short URL

Short URLs shouldn't be used for:

* the majority of URLs - there must be a marketing purpose
* instances where the original URL is already fit for purpose, for example [www.essex.gov.uk/dementia](www.essex.gov.uk/dementia) is the original page URL
* external websites that are not owned by Essex County Council

### Creating short URLs

Short URLs should:

* be simple, clear and easy to read
* make sense and be easy to remember
* use lower case only
* not use dashes or underscores – try to use one word but if you need to use 2, they should be joined, for example [www.essex.gov.uk/energyswitch](www.essex.gov.uk/energyswitch)
* have an expiry date
* have a campaign tracking code
* have an owner who can confirm when the short URL is no longer in use

## Redirects

### What are they?

A redirect sends users and search engines to a different URL from the one originally requested. 

They are used to prevent broken links.

### When to use a redirect

Redirects should be used when:

* content is unpublished or archived
* URLs are changed – this could be due to a significant change in page title or for SEO reasons
* content is moved to a new location, impacting the URL

### When not to use redirects

Redirects should not be used:

* frequently
* for marketing purposes - see short URLs
