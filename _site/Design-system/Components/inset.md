	<div class="section-heading">There are over 260 grit bins.</div>
  <p>
    Use the salt in the grit bins provided by us to clear snow and ice from public roads and pavements. It's illegal and irresponsible to use this salt on your private property and driveways.

## Using insets

An inset is a visual aid to differentiate an excerpt of text from the body of content. It should contain information that's useful or important to the user.

<div class="inset">
  <p>
  	It can be embedded anywhere within the body content of a page.
  </p>
</div>

It shouldn't be used instead of an <a href="/docs/core/components/alert">alert</a> which should provide very important information for a limited time. This could be both service or system alerts.

** Note: ** * the Stockport codebase uses the term Alert Inline for what we call Inset. *
