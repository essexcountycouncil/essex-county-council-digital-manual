Before you do anything to change an existing service or create a new one you need to put some time into discovery and insight.

## Understanding existing products and services

Find out as much as you can about how successful the existing products or service is for users. Use the following to inform you:

- Google Analytics data
- Online feedback
- Phone call volumes and anecdotal insight from the advisors
- [User testing](/essex-service-transformation-playbook/Service-Transformation-team/User-need/User-testing)

Analysing multiple sources of data means that you have a rounded view of behaviour. It’s only when you do this that you start to see the whole picture which may be lost by just looking at web stats.

**For example:** You can identify services which have high call volumes for general information queries which would suggest that we need to do some work to promote or improve our online services.
