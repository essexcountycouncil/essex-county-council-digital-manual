An example for a Blue Badge application would be:

- **As a** person with a mobility problem
- **I want to** apply for a Blue Badge permit
- **So that** I can park directly outside my house and and the shops

To demonstrate that you have delivered the right content to meet the user need you would develop a set of acceptance criteria which would include the user being able to:

- find the application online
- understand the eligibility criteria
- know what the permit does and doesn’t entitle them to
- know what documentation they need to support their application
- know the format the documentation needs to be in i.e. scan, original and how/where to send it
- know how long the process takes

You would test this with a sample of real users using your content.
