## Using content breaks

Content breaks are visual elements used to separate sections of content.

They should be used to:
<ul>
  <li>thematically divide up sections of content, such as services, news and legislation</li>
  <li>show a divide between a list of clickable items, such as news articles, service links or guidance documents</li>
</ul>

They shouldn't be used to divide paragraphs within the body of content.
