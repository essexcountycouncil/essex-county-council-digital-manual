## Using hero

A hero image is used to promote council campaigns.

Images should always:
<ul>
  <li>be meaningful and support the campaign</li>
  <li>be text-free - text should be added to the <a href="overlay">overlay</a>, not the image</li>
  <li>have alt text</li>
</ul>

A hero image can be used on the homepage and topic pages that have a campaign focus, such as the news landing page.

It shouldn't be used on information and topic pages.
